      <h1>Cynthia's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi I'm Cynthia. I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science and Statistics at Cornell University. 
          I like photography and playing tennis and traveling. I was born and raised in New York and spend most of my time 
          taking pictures, hanging out with my friends, or learning new things. I like to read and do my best to keep reading even 
          when life gets hectic. <!--[add other stuff]-->
